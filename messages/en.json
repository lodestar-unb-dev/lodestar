          "visibleContent": "When it comes to monitoring strategic assets that include our natural resources, the challenge goes beyond just tracking them to also perceive them. By perceiving them we mean understanding, learning and growing from their random and uncertain nature. It means empowering ourselves to deal with the unknown, understanding the impact of our actions and preparing ourselves to make decisions in complex scenarios. To achieve a high level of perception on a scale never seen before to monitor our strategic assets, we need to combine sensor networks, space technologies and data science. We need a team of experts, critical sense, and solid partnerships. This is the vision of the Perception project.",
          "hiddenContent": "<p> The Perception System is a satellite data collection system, which, through new systems engineering approaches, new operating concepts, and proposed services based on CubeSats missions, aims to develop new technologies and satellite-based services for tracking and monitoring strategic assets, such as the Brazilian biomes and our critical infrastructure, leading Brazil into a new era of space and terrestrial data science. Satellite technologies and geospatial data have the potential to support the sustainable transition of the Brazilian productive sector and play a vital role in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. The first deliverable of the Perception project is the concept of operation for the space segment, and a new ground segment for collecting and processing data from the K34 Tower of the Large-Scale Amazon Biosphere-Atmosphere (LBA) Program, as well as for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that support environmental monitoring activities. A first use of this data is to measure and monitor carbon flow. The K34 tower is located in the Amazon rainforest, approximately 64km from Manaus, for which a new concept of operation is proposed for the installation of satellite communication terminals compatible with the characteristics of the AlfaCrux satellite, as well as satellites from our partners and future missions. The AlfaCrux space mission marks the beginning of this journey, having allowed the demonstration of space technologies and the training of our team. As a second deliverable of the Perception project, it is expected the reactivation of the environmental data collection tower for the Brazilian Cerrado located at the Água Limpa Farm at the University of Brasília. The Água Limpa Farm has an area of approximately 4,500 hectares dedicated to scientific development and technological development and demonstration for the environment. </p> <p> Welcome to the Perception project and come with us to develop new technologies and satellite-based services for tracking and monitoring our strategic assets. </p>",

The AstroJam is a 3U student-led CubeSat designed to perform research at the University of Nottingham, with science payloads supported by the Astropharmacy Research Group and Nottingham Geospatial Institute (NGI). The payloads include a miniaturised fluorescence spectrometer for the in-situ analysis of cell free bioreporters producing analogue astropharmaceuticals and a CubeSat-based GNSS interference mapping payload. Additionally, an ADCS magnetorquer cooperatively developed with the LODESTAR team at the University of Brasilia will be used for detumbling and pointing the satellite. The mission is organised and run by students from various departments, involving them at Bachelor, Masters and PhD level and enabling them to develop their theses into hands-on, working pieces of space technology. The AstroJam main bus subsystems (OBC, EPS and radio transceiver) are commercial off the shelf items, although notably structural components will be partly manufactured in-house at UoN, while other components will be manufactured using additive manufacturing technologies from specialised companies in Nottingham and Europe. AstroJam will provide both IOD of the first CubeSat hosted GNSS interference mapping payload, as well as validation of the first University-led biomedical CubeSat payload - both cutting-edge research areas that have well cited potential applications. The in-situ culturing and analysis of cell-free synthesised astropharmaceutical molecules has almost limitless applications to microgravity research and technology to support future crewed missions for food and medicine production, waste treatment and ISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilisation). Similarly, the ability to monitor GNSS interference using relatively low-cost satellites may lead to future constellations dedicated to GNSS signal monitoring, increasing revisit time, and allowing resources to be focused on areas with degraded performance. The LODESTAR team will also support the AstroJam mission in the ground segment by receiving telemetry in a reliable communication channel.

In addition, any radio amateur is invited to receive the satellite telemetry, share it, and cooperate in the SDR experiments. Data received by the radio amateur community around the world will be collected and sorted along with data downloaded by the command-and-control ground station PT2ENE of the Laboratory of Simulation and Control of Aerospace Systems, the LODESTAR, University of Brasilia, UnB. An online form is available below to send the collected data along with some extra information. An electronic QSL card will be sent by email to those that have sent the information using our online form. The telemetry data packets can be seen and analyzed in the<em> <strong> <a href=\"https://mission-control.lodestar.aerospace.unb.br\" rel=\"noreferrer\" > AlfaCrux Mission Control platform </a> </strong> </em> . Moreover,<em> <strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lodestar.cdn.prismic.io/lodestar/5e184924-9374-4062-a03c-74cbb1c2a211_AlfaCrux_telemetry_modulation_codes_format.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\" > a description of the telemetry beacons can be seen here </a> </strong> </em> . </p> <p> The AlfaCrux team at the University of Brasilia informs that the AlfaCrux satellite project, an educational and technological demonstration mission in the area of telecommunication, is in full compliance with the national regulatory framework for telecommunications. The project&apos;s Coordination complied with all procedures in the National Telecommunications Agency (ANATEL) for usage of orbit and spectrum resources as a Brazilian satellite, having the Agency complied with all necessary procedures in the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), and officially requested the frequency coordination to the IARU. We would like to reinforce that the frequency band coordination with the countries identified by ITU is concluded, and that on November 1st, 2022, the BR IFIC 2983 was published confirming that the AlfaCrux frequency assignments was properly recorded in the ITU Master Register under Article 11 of the Radio Regulations. Moreover, the applications that are under development in this project are fully in accordance with the radiocommunication and telecommunications services associated to the operation of these frequency bands. The AlfaCrux team would like to thank Sir Hans P. Blondeel Timmerman (PB2T), IARU Satellite Advisor, for providing the AlfaCrux coordination letter on July 5, 2022. </p> <p> We also inform that on July 27, 2022, 01:56 UTC, the AlfaCrux changes to nominal mode, and it is now starting the payload commissioning in orbit. The main services are still not active, only the transmission of beacons with telemetry packets at 437.100 MHz, GMSK modulation, 4800 bps, and circular polarization. Additional information will be updated on this website, the official page of the mission, including details for the correct use of the services by the radio amateur community in the future after finishing the LEOP.
