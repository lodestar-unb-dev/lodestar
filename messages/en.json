          "visibleContent": "When it comes to monitoring strategic assets that include our natural resources, the challenge goes beyond just tracking them to also perceive them. By perceiving them we mean understanding, learning and growing from their random and uncertain nature. It means empowering ourselves to deal with the unknown, understanding the impact of our actions and preparing ourselves to make decisions in complex scenarios. To achieve a high level of perception on a scale never seen before to monitor our strategic assets, we need to combine sensor networks, space technologies and data science. We need a team of experts, critical sense, and solid partnerships. This is the vision of the Perception project.",
          "hiddenContent": "<p> The Perception System is a satellite data collection system, which, through new systems engineering approaches, new operating concepts, and proposed services based on CubeSats missions, aims to develop new technologies and satellite-based services for tracking and monitoring strategic assets, such as the Brazilian biomes and our critical infrastructure, leading Brazil into a new era of space and terrestrial data science. Satellite technologies and geospatial data have the potential to support the sustainable transition of the Brazilian productive sector and play a vital role in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. The first deliverable of the Perception project is the concept of operation for the space segment, and a new ground segment for collecting and processing data from the K34 Tower of the Large-Scale Amazon Biosphere-Atmosphere (LBA) Program, as well as for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that support environmental monitoring activities. A first use of this data is to measure and monitor carbon flow. The K34 tower is located in the Amazon rainforest, approximately 64km from Manaus, for which a new concept of operation is proposed for the installation of satellite communication terminals compatible with the characteristics of the AlfaCrux satellite, as well as satellites from our partners and future missions. The AlfaCrux space mission marks the beginning of this journey, having allowed the demonstration of space technologies and the training of our team. As a second deliverable of the Perception project, it is expected the reactivation of the environmental data collection tower for the Brazilian Cerrado located at the Água Limpa Farm at the University of Brasília. The Água Limpa Farm has an area of approximately 4,500 hectares dedicated to scientific development and technological development and demonstration for the environment. </p> <p> Welcome to the Perception project and come with us to develop new technologies and satellite-based services for tracking and monitoring our strategic assets. </p>",

The AstroJam is a 3U student-led CubeSat designed to perform research at the University of Nottingham, with science payloads supported by the Astropharmacy Research Group and Nottingham Geospatial Institute (NGI). The payloads include a miniaturised fluorescence spectrometer for the in-situ analysis of cell free bioreporters producing analogue astropharmaceuticals and a CubeSat-based GNSS interference mapping payload. Additionally, an ADCS magnetorquer cooperatively developed with the LODESTAR team at the University of Brasilia will be used for detumbling and pointing the satellite. The mission is organised and run by students from various departments, involving them at Bachelor, Masters and PhD level and enabling them to develop their theses into hands-on, working pieces of space technology. The AstroJam main bus subsystems (OBC, EPS and radio transceiver) are commercial off the shelf items, although notably structural components will be partly manufactured in-house at UoN, while other components will be manufactured using additive manufacturing technologies from specialised companies in Nottingham and Europe. AstroJam will provide both IOD of the first CubeSat hosted GNSS interference mapping payload, as well as validation of the first University-led biomedical CubeSat payload - both cutting-edge research areas that have well cited potential applications. The in-situ culturing and analysis of cell-free synthesised astropharmaceutical molecules has almost limitless applications to microgravity research and technology to support future crewed missions for food and medicine production, waste treatment and ISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilisation). Similarly, the ability to monitor GNSS interference using relatively low-cost satellites may lead to future constellations dedicated to GNSS signal monitoring, increasing revisit time, and allowing resources to be focused on areas with degraded performance. The LODESTAR team will also support the AstroJam mission in the ground segment by receiving telemetry in a reliable communication channel. The LODESTAR team thanks the University of Nottingham for the partnership!",

By innovative framework we mean a new architecture for improving and strengthening education in the broad area of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). It is another contribution of the AlfaCrux team to deliver solutions for in-orbit data processing and management; new approaches for attitude determination, control, and reconstruction; space weather analysis and impact on UHF communication links; prognoses and satellite health management, among others. The management, processing, and analysis of all this information, along with the ground infrastructure, come together in the development of Digi-AlfaCrux, the digital twin version of the AlfaCrux. </p> <p> It also makes it easier and immediate for all users to see and understand the meaning and purpose of the AlfaCrux downlink signal in accordance with the amateur-satellite service. All frames available online are properly associated with the call sign responsible for the information. </p> <p> The AlfaCrux telemetry data is free of charge and openly distributed, but if you used the AlfaCrux data on your research and studies, please don’t forget to cite us!
